//build current project: fpkg build debug/release/whatever config > To work check for CMakeLists.txt or Makefile or fpkg.lua
//  This command is mainly intended to simplify build process on CI servers
//package current project: fpkg package > Check for fpkg.lua
//  This command can be used to build a custom package (defined in fpkg.lua) or to build a fpkg package file itself for the current platform
//install libraries/sdks for current project: fpkg install > Check for fpkg.lua
//  This command accepts an optional platform name and by default will consider the build to be for the current platform. (ex: fpkg install android)
// For install process:
//      Create hidden .fpkg folder at the root of the project, the folder should contain all libraries needed to build the project
//      The folder should contain a build file for the current build system to be included in the build system
//      The folder should contain a build file for the current build system to be included in the build system for each sdk named by the name of the sdk
// SDKs should be downloaded and installed in a cache directory as usually SDKs contains additional build tools
// For fpkg.lua find process (when running fpkg install):
//      Parse CMakeLists.txt in the current project folder, if it exists locate project calls inside and for each of those calls:
//          Search the directory in the project call for fpkg.lua, if found then run install process for the sub-project
//      Leave a chance to define subprojects inside of fpkg.lua in case there is no CMakeLists.txt in the current project folder

//The idea:
//  - No packages is built on the current user's local machine to avoid incompatible build environments
//  - All packages must be pre-compiled for all configurations (debug, release, etc) on a given supported platform
//  - At least all publically available packages MUST be building and running under OSX Sierra +, Ubuntu 18 + and Windows 7+
//  - Optionally a package can provide binarries for any other platform even Android
//  - Any package that does not respect any of the previous requirements may still be published but not to the main registry
//  - A package will be distributed as a compressed archive file containing builds for all configurations of a given platform.
